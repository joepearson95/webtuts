## A Learning Project

Whilst this project is for learning, it is a fun project that may be used to give back to the local area too.

This project will allow me to get my Laravel skills back up to 2020 standards and is a fun project too. A more detailed 'specification' can be found in this repository under the name 'srs.odt'.

### Sprints
Just incase this is missed. I will be utilising Kanban and sprint like tracking of this project. Please see applicable areas on this project.
